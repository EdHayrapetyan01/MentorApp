## About the App

Mentor app is an frontend test application written by React, and the main concepts are the sign-up , manage matched profiles, user profile. The application have a registration process, multi-step profile filling (2 steps), and a third step — making a match suggestion.

## Technologies

React, sass, react router dom, reactstrap for ui, uuid, redux-thunk, csvtojson, fake server, lodash,

## Approach

Here i used client side rendering, and for the routing system i used react-router-dom which is the most popular and improven lib for me,one time used inferno-react which i didn't like , also in the app i used the kebab-case naming style for classnames, used local storage to save user data, and fake api with csv json package to parse the data on the front side. Also i wrote some backend with nodejs, used passport.js for authentication and mongo atlas, but for my less time i didn't finish all the implementation, but attached is a  repo link
